				<text>The death penalty should apply only in cases where the

				<text>I see your point and this would probably work fine with those
					three examples, but it sets a dangerous precedent. What constitutes
					undisputable evidence (for instance)? These people also have the
					right to appeal their convictions, so there's no real way to simply
					execute them and save money (they appeal and stay in death row for
					decades). Ironically, death row inmates cost significantly more
					money to the state than a regular inmate and so there really isn't
					even a monetary benefit to the death penalty. I just want to say I
					agree with the sentiment, maybe they deserve to die. However,
					there's no real way to carry that out justly.

				<text>Ostracize them. If they give consent, tattoo their crime
					across their forehead, take their bio-metrics and add them to a
					blacklist describing their crimes and then let them back into the
					community. If they don't agree to that I'm sure members of the
					community will gladly show them the way out of town and warn
					surrounding communities of the threat headed their way. To be
					shunned by friends, family and community in addition to every
					employer turning them away is a punishment worse than death in many

				<text>Still cheaper than death row. The 'reasonable doubt'

					- therefore more cost. Even with that strictness, you still get

				<text>I tend to be pro-death penalty (for both murder and rape), but
					for once I'm seeing a coherent argument against my position.
					Usually the arguments are about racial bias in the police and legal
					system, which is a fact, but that would not be solved by getting
					rid of the death penalty. You'd still have racial bias-- just a
					bunch of lifelong sentences instead of death sentences. The risk of
					being wrong is by comparison one which is actually directly
					related. I won't say I'm fully swayed, but I will say there's a
					serious amount of stuff in this argument that is worth thinking
					about.﻿

				<text>Of course the death penalty isn't a deterrent. It takes 20 to
					30 years to be put to death. The news doesn't report a murder that
					is soon followed by a trial and execution. The only time the media
					reports an execution, you can be sure that the crime and
					trial happened decades earlier. The threat of execution just isn't
					real enough. It's like the threat of dying from cancer 30 years
					down the road isn't real to a smoker. If you died months after
					smoking, not a single person would smoke (unless they had a death
					wish).﻿

					 To say a bad chemist is a good argument for disallowing the death

				<text>The best way to silence arguments against the death penalty
					(because the way it's administered is "cruel") is to hook up the
					condemned to an oxygen tube that supplies pure nitrogen. The person
					will grow sleepy with no symptoms of being oxygen deprived and die

					can be transplanted. This method was beta tested (inadvertently) on

				<text>Why not? Killing someone is justified in various instances,

					a somewhat benevolent punishment, at least compared to long decades
					of dependence, indignity and violence at the literal bottom of the
					society, among its worst. If the punishment is inflicted on a
					terrorist or a traitor - a quick, "soldier's death" is more
					dignified than keeping them confined and brainwashed, like some
					wicked living trophy. Let's face it - life is not the most
					important value, and if we want the humanity to do more than just
					live and eat - it should not be.

				<text>Sure, there are situations where mistakes are made, and people
					get executed unjustly. But this is not an argument for abolishing
					the death penalty. Accidents happen - sometimes innocent people die
					in car crashes, but I don't this is a sufficient reason to
					eliminate motor vehicles. Death penalty is supposed to deter people
					from committing premeditated murder - not murder in general (I
					don't think it should apply to, say, crimes of passion). Besides,
					it tends to be rather uncommon - so, that may be a couple of
					reasons for the lack of strong correlation.

				<text>I didn't see a real argument for complete abolishment there. I
					completely agree that we should never kill someone who might be
					innocent, but some crimes really do merit death. The first story
					the guy shared? Those 2 boys didn't deserve death, but the guy who
					actually committed the crime sure did. My position is just that the
					bar should be raised for death penalty cases. Instead of reasonable
					doubt, or does the crime merit death, the bar that must be crossed
					should be zero doubt. The crime was caught on film or in front of a
					group of many ironclad witnesses. Fewer capital sentences, but not
					outright abolishment.﻿

				<text>abolish? no restrict? yes.  with modern video and DNA

					a mass shooter confirmed on video cameras, ect. should have the
					option of death penalty, when your face is on the video that
					they're using as evidence against you, you really can't say "the
					police screwed up the forensics" and you need to be permanently

				<text>can go wrong but it's much more rare because it's a far more

					However no death penalty is acceptable as stated by the video

				<text>I respectfully disagree. The whole point of a justice system
					is the enforcement of necessary moral and legal norms. Punishment
					of crime is necessary for the maintenance of those norms. On the
					subject of using prisoners labors for a social good, I find that to
					be a dehumanizing and demeaning argument. To do so would be to
					treat prisoners as means to a social end rather than ends in
					themselves. We must respect their humanity by holding them
					accountable for their crimes, not use them as tools for our
					convenience.

				<text>The problem I see is that the so called "justice system" is
					flawed. The cops, detectives, forensics, lawyers and judges all
					participate in a system that unjustly convicts innocent people. Are
					you saying that none of these people at any point could figure out
					the innocent people were actually innocent. The problem is in the
					system, not so much the punishment. If people's biases due to race,
					class, religion, gender, hatred, revenge, etc. can be removed from
					the process and replaced with facts, maybe it would work as
					intended. Until then, good luck to anyone who gets dragged into

				<text>This would be a more convincing argument if he had examples of

					Would they still be in prison had they not been on death row?

				<text>You're right, I was a little off topic. I wrote it quickly...
					But the latter part of my post holds true. Decisions are relative,
					so whatever number you output from your formula needs to be
					compared to something. When C=0, that quantifies value AFTER the
					person is dead. A person who is deciding if death is better than
					current conditions must then quantify their life BEFORE they die,
					which means C=1, thus all other values matter. If that output is
					less than 0, then death is a step up. If you prevent death to such
					a person, then you're prolonging their suffering.

				<text>yeah, the recent escape of multiple known murders in States

				<text>Heck yeah. Here in Texas, we don't even care if they're guilty
					before we execute them.  There's been at least five in the last 20
					years that we're almost certain were innocent. Michael Morton was
					on death row 25 years before they finally figured out the
					Williamson County prosecutor was a lying sack of shit hell bent on
					racking up convictions and let him go.  If they'd had that
					express-lane thing, they could have just buried the truth along
					with Mr. Morton and  nobody would been the wiser.  We don't really
					go for "wise" all that much in Texas.  Makes people feel funny.﻿

				<text>The only reason why the death penalty wouldn't be a deterrent
					because the murderers are not afraid or convinced by it. Some
					murderers may even want to die, but in a way that they could
					suddenly wreak havoc for their own selfishness. The Constitution
					doesn't allow "cruel and unusual punishment", and I bet a lot of us
					would implement such! ﻿

				<text>So logically, if a murderer is afraid to die, then why would
					he replicate that fear on those he harms? Only at the point where
					you forfeit your life completely do you realize that other lives
					are forfeit as well. That's the tried-and-true pathology of any
					common murderer and I'm talking about the premeditated kind and not
					the passionate. If you don't think I have common sense, then you
					know nothing about our crime and punishment system and probably
					should be recused from participating in civic duty in that regard,
					due to "incompetence".

				<text>It's not so much about deterrence as it is insuring that
					animal never has a chance to commit further crimes ever again. If
					it deters others, good.  Besides the whole argument against it due
					to lack of deterrence is a biased and false one anyways. You can
					always point to a capital crime and say, "See? He wasn't deterred".
					But the number of crimes that were deterred is impossible to know
					BECAUSE THEY NEVER OCCURRED! I guarantee you one thing though. Any
					who do receive the death penalty. Never commit any crime ever
					again. In that regard it has a 100% success rate.

				<text>against the death penalty myself. not for the normal reasons

					know we can punish them here.

				<text>Regarding the death penalty: Pros: 1. Prevents criminals from
					escaping/being released to commit more crimes. 2. Closure for
					grieving families. 3. Taxpayers don't have to pay to sustain the
					lives of criminals. Cons: 1. Too harsh for some crimes (obviously
					wouldn't do it to a mere petty thief). 2. Not harsh ENOUGH for
					others - let rapists starve in a single cell PACKED with other
					rapists. Nothing is cut-and-dried; this is not a decision to make
					lightly.

				<text>That explains why you didn't directly reply to me. How
					backwards are you? Having the death penalty would still be cheaper
					because there would be relatively less prison guards needed on
					payroll, since they'll just kill the prisoners anyway. Prosecution
					costs are cheaper than that of meals and guards. Law enforcement
					cost would remain the same, as all that's changing are the
					consequences of crimes, not cop behavior. Legal protection would
					only rise a bit in the short run. Long run, still cheaper

				<text>They are illogical because they make no sense whatsoever. The

					cheaper than purchasing a stock of cyanide that would only need to
					be used once for these prisoners. The cost is high, but in the long

				<text>I'm in favor of the death penalty law. Death penalty is not

					to defend itself against criminals, executed criminals will never
					murder again. I'm Italian living &amp; working in Singapore, I
					admire Singapore's discipline &amp; strict death penalty law for
					criminals &amp; drug traffickers; as a result Singapore is a free
					drug society &amp; has low crime rate. I wish there was death

				<text>Shannon, actually spending some decades in jail before being
					excuted is much worse than being brought to death immediately.  The
					whole point of a justice system is to bring justice, also for
					murderers, even murderers of children.  So they are also entitled
					to defend their case with any means, even if it takes years.

				<text>One more thing, Shannon.  Most of the criminality in Western
					Europe is also done by foreigners.  I don't care do much about
					racist opinions.  Since it's just an opinion and I believe in a
					radical freedom of thoughts.  It's just disappointing to see a
					follower of Jesus using racist arguments, while Jesus was anything
					but a racist.  Have a great day ;).

					license... . Murderers reject the food they get in prison because
					their steak is a bit too bloody, etc... it is ridiculous !! One guy

				<text>Number 1 is exactly why the death penalty shouldn't be legal!
					When someone is wrongfully executed for a crime they did not

				<text>Hey retardo, several times I have asked you whats wrong with
					''revenge''. Still you dont give an answer. Probably because you
					dont have one. Also, it was YOU that gave that 88 percent figure to
					ME ( I sent you the actual comment where YOU stated the 88 percent
					statistic ) not me to you. So in summing up: I say you are
					completely clinically mental. And should be sectioned under the
					Mental Health Act. I am still analysing your comments to see if you
					are actually a danger to society. If I feel you are I should really
					notify the authorities. I probably will anyway. Keep an eye out for
					men in white coats and straight jackets.

				<text>We are discussing capital punishment which is scriptural. If

					Jesus was concerned with the Old Testament, he often referred to it

				<text>I'm not dismissing the Old Testament. Like I've said before
					'Thou shall not kill'. Why is it that this particular Commandment
					can be bent but one such as 'Thou shall not commit adultery' can't?
					Pardon me, but I think it more immoral for someone to kill someone
					(whether it be the state or not) than if they gossiped a little bit
					(Thou shall not bear false witness) but seeing as so many
					Christians tend to bend the Bible to their own liking and to fit
					their agenda (Westboro Baptist Church for example) it's little
					wonder that in certain places, say certain American states, you can
					still be jailed for "Sodomy" but you're okay to get the lethal
					injection.

				<text>It seems, as it says in Romans 2 (New Testament) that you may

					your own agenda? Capital punishment is scriptural. God says it, not
					I. See my post 6 May which explains why executioners of the state
					do not commit murder. "Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall
					be put to death"....Exodus 21.12. God says it, not I. I am staying
					on topic, which is - capital punishment.

				<text>So much ignorance about mental illness during this debate. 'It

					these people do these things in the first place. It's not on a whim
					just because you want to do something horrible to another person.
					What about if they're high on drugs or mentally ill. To say it's a

				<text>In my opinion, death penalty is a justified punishment for
					people found guilty of severe crimes like mass killing, torturing
					and raping, assuming the person perpertrating these crimes was of a
					sound mind at the time of these crimes and shows no signs of regret
					or improvement... Death penalty acts like a perfect deterrent and

				<text>I'm against the death penalty for many reasons. First, it
					doesn't get to the root of them problem and fix the causes that
					compel them to a crime. Second, if the threat of going to jail
					doesn't deter someone from a crime, then how would the threat of
					killing them be any more effective. Third, it's possible for people
					to be killed who have never committed the crime. But most
					importantly, it sends the wrong message. It says "It's not okay for
					you as a citizen to kill someone, but it's okay for the government
					to kill you."﻿

				<text>Fact is the death penalty costs more (so you can use 'oh we
					tax payers have to pay to keep them in prison) because of the
					longer process of ensuring its the right decision.  It does not
					reduce crime rates what so ever, do you think the average person is
					likely to rape, beat or murder someone?  Those are people who do it
					in the heat of the moment (anger), under the influence of
					drugs/alcohol or suffer from mental illnesses.  ﻿

				<text>Priti Patel view is; -'shot first, ask questions when the

				<text>It is obvious that no moral argument is going to sway the
					hangers, floggers, and bashers, so perhaps change of tack is
					needed? I propose, that the names and addresses of Death Penalty
					supporters be kept in a register, and should it be reinstated,
					every time an innocent person gets the chop, a dozen or so randomly
					selected people on this list should be forced to meet the victim's
					family face-to-face, negotiate a price for the victim's life, and
					compensate them with the agreed amount out of their own pockets.
					What's the betting that as soon as money is involved, all of a
					sudden they will acquire some principles, and life imprisonment
					will be the preferred option?﻿

				<text>yeah and you've been in solitary confinement it seems. There

					liberals will be the first to kill themselves when put in this

					realize what it means to end your existence forever you wouldn't go

				<text>after 22nd week it is considered that there's intent to carry

				<text>Life in prison without possibility of parole, is worse
					punishment than death for those that don't believe in anything
					beyond this life. But the fact that there've been many innocent
					people exonerated that are on death row destroys the entire
					justification for the death penalty. If just ONE innocent person is
					put to death the entire system is morally reprehensible. The FBI
					just he classified how their hair analysis was flawed in many
					convictions we're based on erroneous data. Anyone who you would
					think be eligible for the death penalty give them life without the
					possibility of parole(unless further evidence exonerates them) and
					you have done the the victims family Justice.

				<text>4. Again, looking at the argument objectively instead of

					furthermore it does not justify someone murdering you. If you could
					come up with a new argument with some substance that could morally

				<text>Murdering and killing are not the same thing. Murder is an
					unlawful and premeditated killing of a human being by another. A
					kill, is the act of ending the life of someone. Would you consider
					a cop killing a criminal that's threatening your life a murderer?
					Would you feel safe, living under a government that is not allowed
					to take someone who's trying to kill you down? I don't think so.

				<text>Actually the death penalty costs more, way more. And states

				<text>Capital punishment is wrong, nothing more than planned
					ritualistic murder, nothing more than modern day human sacrifice.
					when a weapon is used to destroy someone, the weapon has to be
					destroyed, and that should include the state that causes another
					murder to happen. The worst capital punishment is the executions
					carried by governments in public that are so subtle and secret it

				<text>I'm totally in favor of the death penalty law. Death penalty
					is not murder, it is self defense, society has to defend itself
					against criminals, executed criminals will never murder again. I'm
					Italian living &amp; working in Singapore, I love it in Singapore,
					I admire Singapore's discipline &amp; strict death penalty law for
					criminals &amp; drug traffickers; as a result Singapore is a free
					drug society &amp; has low crime rate. Death penalty is truly a
					deterrent to crime. I wish there was death penalty in Italy. Crimes
					are increasing in countries where there's no death penalty &amp;
					where jails are like 1st class hotels﻿

				<text>the last comment in this video posed an interesting concept:
					-the relationship between progressivism, capital punishment, and
					secularism. My question is to those who would say they are secular
					in the sense of believing Darwinist/evolutionary theory &amp; who
					DO NOT believe in capital punishment. -As a secularist in this
					sense, why is capital punishment wrong if it is merely a playing
					out of "survival of the fittest"?﻿

				<text>There shouldn't be a debate over the DP. You either believe in
					killing people, or you don't. Also, if you do believe in killing,
					and you support the DP, then you are ok with killing the innocent
					as well. Innocent are executed for the privilege of getting revenge
					on the guilty. This is inevitable and irrefutable.﻿

				<text>Death penalty is such an ignorant response to crime. It does
					not do to solve a problem by suggesting the problem itself as a

				<text>Reasons why I'm against the death penalty: A) Innocent people
					are killed (5/100 on average in America) B) It's proven not to
					reduce crime in the area, so is not effective in preventing crime
					C) Wheres the line drawn between life sentence and execution (one
					brutal killing cutting a kid open vs 5 shootings which is worse) D)
					Ethnic minorities are more likely than whites to be executed for
					the same crime E) Wealthy are less likely to get executed than the
					poor (quality of lawyer should not determine life or death) F)
					'Killing those who kill to teach them a lesson' is hypocritical in
					itself G) it's becomes a matter of revenge not justice H) is more
					expensive﻿

				<text>Man kills 69 teenagers and stays 21 years in Norwegian hotel
					prison. He admits hes crimes and doesn't regret and rallies hes
					fans and talks about killing more people. That seems fair? Some
					people, even some parents of the victims, said that he will feel
					bad inside and that's big enough punishment. Whoo let him go!﻿

				<text>I'm from Houston so you know my take on this but just like the

				<text>I don't favor the death penalty, but there are some people who

				<text>I don't think the death penalty shoul be seen as a deterent
					because the people that deserve it probably won't care about it. I
					don't think it should be a go to but I definatly think there are
					special cases where it is right. If someone has raped children
					or murdered a lot of people then there is no use keeping them
					around.﻿

				<text>In america the new and improved death penalty will be a cash
					cow for the private jails. Death penalty is for the lazy and greedy
					soon to be the greedy and lazy. We all know the decapitated human
					body can be kept alive with right equipment for an indefinite
					amount of time right?. You would need a stockpile of stackable,
					storage, watertight containers (fema coffins?) that could hold one
					body plus equipment. You know for the "freshness" factor in the
					organ harvesting (&amp; other fluid an bits) by the aging elites.
					Well I would hope its for organs and not just a handy dandy snack
					in a pack for something else...﻿</text>
